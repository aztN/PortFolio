## About

Hi! I'm a beginner front-end web developer who enjoys building creative and responsive websites. My journey started in college, and I eventually joined [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some projects that helped me get started:

- **[Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-71)** - Learning the basics of HTML.
- **[Café Menu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-91)** - Learning CSS layout and styling.

These projects helped me build a solid foundation in front-end development, and I’m now working toward becoming a professional web developer.
